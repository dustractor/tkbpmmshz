notes:

not all python distributions come with tkinter anymore.

windows users can make a shortcut to vbs script to have a way to launch this without using terminal or having an extra terminal window. If you use the github app to clone the repo to the default location (folder named GitHub inside your Documents folder) the launchers should work ootb but otherwise you will have to edit the paths in the cmd & vbs scripts to point to the correct location
